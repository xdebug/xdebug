	  (Patch by Maxim Poltarak <demiurg@gmail.com>)


Sun, Nov 28, 2004 - xdebug 2.0.0beta2
+ Added new features:
	- DBGP: Added error messages to returned errors (in most cases)
  
+ Added new functions:
	- xdebug_debug_zval() to debug zvals by printing its refcounts and is_ref
	  values.
  
= Changed features:
	- xdebug_code_coverage_stop() will now clean up the code coverage array,
	  unless you specify FALSE as parameter.
	- The proper Xdebug type is "hash" for associative arrays.
	- Extended the code-coverage functionality by returning lines with
	  executable code on them, but where not executed with a count value of -1.

= Fixed bugs:
	- DBGP: Make property_get and property_value finally work as they should,
	  including retrieving information from different depths then the most top
	  stack frame.
	- DBGP: Fix eval'ed $varnames in property_get.
	- DBGP: Support the -d option for property_get.
	- Fixed the exit handler hook to use the new "5.1" way of handling it;
	  which fortunately also works with PHP 5.0.
	- Fixed bug #102: Problems with configure for automake 1.8.
	- Fixed bug #101: crash with set_exeception_handler() and uncatched exceptions.
	- Fixed bug #99: unset variables return the name as a string with property_get.
	- Fixed bug #98: 'longname' attribute not returned for unintialized
	  property in context_get request.
	- Fixed bug #94: xdebug_sprintf misbehaves with x86_64/glibc-2.3.3
	- Fixed bug #93: Crash in lookup_hostname on x86_64
	- Fixed bug #92: xdebug_disable() doesn't disable the exception handler.
	- Fixed bug #68: Summary not written when script ended with "exit()".


Wed, Sep 15, 2004 - xdebug 2.0.0beta1
+ Added new features:
	- Added support for the new DBGp protocol for communicating with the debug
	  engine.
	- A computerized trace format for easier parsing by external programs.
	- The ability to set remote debugging features via the environment.  This
	  allows an IDE to emulate CGI and still pass the configuration through to
	  the debugger.  In CGI mode, PHP does not allow -d arguments.
	- Reimplementation of the tracing code, you can now only trace to file; this greatly
	  enhances performance as no string representation of variables need to be
	  kept in memory any more.
	- Re-implemented profiling support. Xdebug outputs information the same way
	  that cachegrind does so it is possible to use Kcachegrind as front-end.
	- Xdebug emits warnings when it was not loaded as a Zend extension.
	- Added showing private, protected and public to the fancy var_dump()
	  replacement function.
	- Added the setting of the TCP_NODELAY socket option to stop delays in
	  transferring data to the remote debugger client. (Patch by Christof J.  Reetz)
	+ DebugClient: Added setting for port to listen on and implemented running
	  the previous command when pressing just enter.

+ Added new functions:
	- xdebug_get_stack_depth() to return the current stack depth level.
	- xdebug_get_tracefile_name() to retrieve the name of the tracefile. This
	  is useful in case auto trace is enabled and you want to clean the trace
	  file.
	- xdebug_peak_memory_usage() which returns the peak memory
	  used in a script. (Only works when --enable-memory-limit was enabled)

+ Added feature requests:
	- FR #5: xdebug_break() function which interupts the script for the debug
	  engine.
	- FR #30: Dump current scope information in stack traces on error.
	- FR #88: Make the url parameter XDEBUG_SESSION_START optional. So it can
	  be disabled and the user does not need to add it.

+ Added new php.ini settings:
	- xdebug.auto_trace_file: to configure a trace file to write to as addition
	  to the xdebug.auto_trace setting which just turns on tracing.
	- xdebug.collect_includes: separates collecting
	  names of include files from the xdebug.collect_params setting.
	- xdebug.collect_return: showing return values in traces.
	- xdebug.dump_global: with which you can turn off dumping of super globals
	  even in you have that configured.
	- xdebug.extended_info: turns off the generation of extended opcodes that
	  are needed for stepping and breakpoints for the remote debugger. This is
	  useful incase you want to profile memory usage as the generation of this
	  extended info increases memory usage of oparrrays by about 33%. 
	- xdebug.profiler_output_dir: profiler output directory.
	- xdebug.profiler_enable: enable the profiler.
	- xdebug.show_local_vars: turn off the showing of local variables in the
	  top most stack frame on errors.
	- xdebug.show_mem_delta: show differences between current and previous
	  memory usage on a function call level.
	- xdebug.trace_options: to configure extra
	  options for trace dumping:
		o XDEBUG_TRACE_APPEND option (1)

= Changed features:
	- xdebug_start_trace() now returns the filename of the tracefile (.xt is
	  added to the requested name).
	- Changed default debugging protocol to dbgp instead of gdb.
	- Changed default debugger port from 17869 to 9000.
	- Changed trace file naming: xdebug.trace_output_dir is now used to
	  configure a directory to dump automatic traces; the trace file name now
	  also includes the pid (xdebug.trace_output_name=pid) or a crc32 checksum
	  of the current working dir (xdebug.trace_output_name=crc32) and traces
	  are not being appended to an existing file anymore, but simply
	  overwritten.
	- Removed $this and $GLOBALS from showing variables in the local scope.

- Removed functions:
	- xdebug_get_function_trace/xdebug_dump_function_trace() because of the new
	  idea of tracing.

= Fixed bugs:
	- Fixed bug #89: var_dump shows empty strings garbled.
	- Fixed bug #85: Xdebug segfaults when no idekey is set.
	- Fixed bug #83: More than 32 parameters functions make xdebug crash.
	- Fixed bug #75: xdebug's var_dump implementation is not binary safe.
	- Fixed bug #73: komodo beta 4.3.7 crash.
	- Fixed bug #72: breakpoint_get returns wrong structure.
	- Fixed bug #69: Integer overflow in cachegrind summary.
	- Fixed bug #67: Filenames in Xdebug break URI RFC with spaces.
	- Fixed bug #64: Missing include of xdebug_compat.h.
	- Fixed bug #57: Crash with overloading functions.
	- Fixed bug #54: source command did not except missing -f parameter.
	- Fixed bug #53: Feature get misusing the supported attribute.
	- Fixed bug #51: Only start a debug session if XDEBUG_SESSION_START is
	  passed as GET or POST parameter, or the DBGP_COOKIE is send to the server.
	  Passing XDEBUG_SESSION_STOP as GET/POST parameter will end the debug
	  session and removes the cookie again. The cookie is also passed to the
	  remote handler backends; for DBGp it is added to the <init> packet.
	- Fixed bug #49: Included file's names should not be stored by address.
	- Fixed bug #44: Script time-outs should be disabled when debugging.
	- Fixed bug #36: GDB handler using print causes segfault with wrong syntax
	- Fixed bug #33: Implemented the use of the ZEND_POST_DEACTIVATE hook. Now we
	  can handle destructors safely too.
	- Fixed bug #32: Unusual dynamic variables cause xdebug to crash.


Fri, Dec 26, 2003 - xdebug 1.3.0

+ GDB: Added file/line to signals. (Derick)
= Fixed logging to adhere to the error_reporting setting. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #32: Unusual dynamic variables cause xdebug to crash. (Ilia)
= Fixed bug #31: & entity replaced after others, wrong HTML output. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #22: Segmentation fault with xdebug_get_function_stack() and
  collect_params=1. (Derick)


Tue, Nov 08, 2003 - xdebug 1.3.0rc2

+ Added version info to handlers which show in phpinfo() output. (Derick)
= GDB: Fixed bug with continuing after breakpoint where only 'cont' worked.
  (Derick)
= GDB: Fixed bug in deleting absolute breakpoints on Windows. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #27: Repeated connect attempts when no debugger is listening.
  (Derick)
= Fixed bug #19: The value of xdebug.output_dir in a .htaccess never takes
  effect. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #18: Mistyped sizeof()'s for array indexes in profiler output.
  (Derick)
= Fixed handling stack traces for when display_errors was set to Off. (Derick)
= Fixed segfault where a function name didn't exist in case of a
 "call_user_function". (Derick)
= Fixed reading a filename in case of an callback to a PHP function from an
  internal function (like "array_map()"). (Derick)


Thu, Sep 18, 2003 - xdebug 1.3.0rc1

= Fixed bug with wrong file names for functions called from call_user_*().
  (Derick)
+ Added the option "dump_superglobals" to the remote debugger. If you set this
  option to 0 the "show-local" and similar commands will not return any data
  from superglobals anymore. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #2: "pear package" triggers a segfault. (Derick)
= Fixed crash bug when a function had sprintf style parameters (ie.
  strftime()). (Derick)
+ Added "id" attribute to <var /> elements in responses from the remove
  debugger when the response method is XML. This makes it possible to
  distinguish between unique elements by use of recursion for example. (Derick)
= Improved performance greatly by doing lazy folding of variables outside
  trace mode. (Derick)
= Fixed a bug with "quit", if it was used it disabled the extension for the
  current process. (Derick)
+ Added the "full" argument to the remote command "backtrace". When this
  argument is passed, the local variables will be returned to for each frame in
  the stack. (Derick)
+ Implemented xdebug_time_index() which returns the time passed since the
  start of the script. This change also changes the output of the tracing
  functions as the start time will no longer be the first function call, but
  the real start time of the script. (Derick)
+ Implemented the "show-local" command (shows all local variables in the
  current scope including all contents). (Derick)
+ Implemented conditions for breakpoints in the "break" command. (Derick)


Mon, Apr 21, 2003 - xdebug 1.2.0

  touched during execution. (Derick)
+ Made Xdebug compatible with Zend Engine 2. (Derick)
+ Added dumping of super globals on errors. (Harald Radi)
+ Added XML protocol for the debugger client. (Derick)
= Fixed handling of "continue" (so that it also continues with the script).
  (Derick)
+ Additions to the remote debugger: "eval" (evaluate any PHP code from the
  debugger client). (Derick)
+ Added profiling support to xdebug. This introduces 3 new functions,
  xdebug_start_profiling() that begins profiling process, 
  xdebug_stop_profiling() that ends the profiling process and
  xdebug_dump_function_trace() that dumps the profiling data. (Ilia)
+ Implemented the "kill" (kills the running script) and "delete" (removes
  a breakpoint on a specified element) command. (Derick)

+ Implemented the "list" (source listing), "print" (printing variable
  contents), "show" (show all variables in the scope), "step" (step through
  execution), "pwd" (print working directory), "next" (step over) and "finish"
  (step out) commands for the remote debugger. (Derick)
= Fixed lots of small bugs, under them memory leaks and crash bugs. (Derick)
= Parameters to functions are no longer recorded by default; use the
  xdebug.collect_params=1 setting in php.ini to turn it on again.


Tue Oct 29, 2002 - xdebug 1.1.0pre2

+ Implemented class::method, object->method and file.ext:line style
  breakpoints. (Derick)
= Changed debugger port from 7869 to 17869. (Derick)

  then Xdebug collects all parameters passed to functions, otherwise they
  are not collected at all. (Derick)
+ Implemented correct handling of include/require and eval. (Derick)


Mon Oct 22, 2002 - xdebug 1.1.0pre1

+ Added automatic starting of function traces (xdebug.auto_trace, defaulting to
  "off"). (Derick)
- Xdebug no longer supports PHP versions below PHP 4.3.0pre1. (Derick)
+ Added gdb compatible debugger handler with support for simple (function only)
  breakpoints. (Derick)
= Implemented a new way to get class names and file names. (Derick, Thies C.
  Arntzen <thies@thieso.net>)
+ Added time-index and memory footprint to CLI dumps. (Derick)
+ Implemented remote debugger handler abstraction. (Derick)

  function names. (Derick)
+ Implemented links to the PHP Manual in traces. (Derick)
+ Added timestamps and memory usage to function traces. (Derick)

+ Implemented variable function names ($a = 'foo'; $f();) for use in
  traces. (Derick)


Sun May 26, 2002 - xdebug 0.8.0 - Yoda

+ Implemented much better parameter tracing for user defined
  functions. (Derick)
= Renamed xdebug_get_function_trace() to xdebug_dump_function_trace().
  (Derick)
= Implemented new xdebug_get_function_trace() to return the function trace in
  an array. (Derick)
