???, Mar ??, 2004 - xdebug 2.0.0
+ Added FR #30: Dump current scope information in stack traces on error.
  (Derick)
+ Added FR #5: xdebug_break() function which interupts the script for the debug
  engine. (Derick)
+ Added ini setting "xdebug.dump_global" with which you can turn off dumping of
  super globals even in you have that configured. This is most useful for
  tests. (Derick)
= Changed default debugger port from 17869 to 9000. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #36: GDB handler using print causes segfault with wrong syntax
+ Client: Added setting for port to listen on and implemented running the
  previous command when pressing just enter. (Derick)
+ DBGp: Added new protocol for communicating with the debug engine. (Derick)


Fri, Dec 26, 2003 - xdebug 1.3.0

+ GDB: Added file/line to signals. (Derick)
= Fixed logging to adhere to the error_reporting setting. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #32: Unusual dynamic variables cause xdebug to crash. (Ilia)
= Fixed bug #31: & entity replaced after others, wrong HTML output. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #22: Segmentation fault with xdebug_get_function_stack() and
  collect_params=1. (Derick)


Tue, Nov 08, 2003 - xdebug 1.3.0rc2

+ Added version info to handlers which show in phpinfo() output. (Derick)
= GDB: Fixed bug with continuing after breakpoint where only 'cont' worked.
  (Derick)
= GDB: Fixed bug in deleting absolute breakpoints on Windows. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #27: Repeated connect attempts when no debugger is listening.
  (Derick)
= Fixed bug #19: The value of xdebug.output_dir in a .htaccess never takes
  effect. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #18: Mistyped sizeof()'s for array indexes in profiler output.
  (Derick)
= Fixed handling stack traces for when display_errors was set to Off. (Derick)
= Fixed segfault where a function name didn't exist in case of a
 "call_user_function". (Derick)
= Fixed reading a filename in case of an callback to a PHP function from an
  internal function (like "array_map()"). (Derick)


Thu, Sep 18, 2003 - xdebug 1.3.0rc1

= Fixed bug with wrong file names for functions called from call_user_*().
  (Derick)
+ Added the option "dump_superglobals" to the remote debugger. If you set this
  option to 0 the "show-local" and similar commands will not return any data
  from superglobals anymore. (Derick)
= Fixed bug #2: "pear package" triggers a segfault. (Derick)
= Fixed crash bug when a function had sprintf style parameters (ie.
  strftime()). (Derick)
+ Added "id" attribute to <var /> elements in responses from the remove
  debugger when the response method is XML. This makes it possible to
  distinguish between unique elements by use of recursion for example. (Derick)
= Improved performance greatly by doing lazy folding of variables outside
  trace mode. (Derick)
= Fixed a bug with "quit", if it was used it disabled the extension for the
  current process. (Derick)
+ Added the "full" argument to the remote command "backtrace". When this
  argument is passed, the local variables will be returned to for each frame in
  the stack. (Derick)
+ Implemented xdebug_time_index() which returns the time passed since the
  start of the script. This change also changes the output of the tracing
  functions as the start time will no longer be the first function call, but
  the real start time of the script. (Derick)
+ Implemented the "show-local" command (shows all local variables in the
  current scope including all contents). (Derick)
+ Implemented conditions for breakpoints in the "break" command. (Derick)


Mon, Apr 21, 2003 - xdebug 1.2.0

= Fixed compilation on MacOSX. (Derick)


Tue, Apr 15, 2003 - xdebug 1.2.0rc2

+ Added code coverage functions to check which lines and how often they were
  touched during execution. (Derick)
+ Made Xdebug compatible with Zend Engine 2. (Derick)
+ Added dumping of super globals on errors. (Harald Radi)
+ Added XML protocol for the debugger client. (Derick)
= Fixed handling of "continue" (so that it also continues with the script).
  (Derick)
+ Additions to the remote debugger: "eval" (evaluate any PHP code from the
  debugger client). (Derick)
+ Added profiling support to xdebug. This introduces 3 new functions,
  xdebug_start_profiling() that begins profiling process, 
  xdebug_stop_profiling() that ends the profiling process and
  xdebug_dump_function_trace() that dumps the profiling data. (Ilia)
+ Implemented the "kill" (kills the running script) and "delete" (removes
  a breakpoint on a specified element) command. (Derick)

+ Implemented the "list" (source listing), "print" (printing variable
  contents), "show" (show all variables in the scope), "step" (step through
  execution), "pwd" (print working directory), "next" (step over) and "finish"
  (step out) commands for the remote debugger. (Derick)
= Fixed lots of small bugs, under them memory leaks and crash bugs. (Derick)
= Parameters to functions are no longer recorded by default; use the
  xdebug.collect_params=1 setting in php.ini to turn it on again.


Tue Oct 29, 2002 - xdebug 1.1.0pre2

+ Implemented class::method, object->method and file.ext:line style
  breakpoints. (Derick)
= Changed debugger port from 7869 to 17869. (Derick)

  breakpoints. (Derick)

  Arntzen <thies@thieso.net>)

  function names. (Derick)
+ Implemented links to the PHP Manual in traces. (Derick)

  (Derick)
= Implemented new xdebug_get_function_trace() to return the function trace in

  speficies. (Derick)
