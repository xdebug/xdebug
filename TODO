For 1.3.0:
- Bug fixing
  * Double check file/line breakpoints
  * Fix memleaks with the eval command
  * Fix "cont" in remote debugger, test case:

  [script]
  
	<?php
		$a = 'foo';

		function foo() {
			$b = 2;
			echo $GLOBALS['a'];
		}

		foo();
	?>

  [debug commands]

	(init /home/derick/test2.php) bre foo
	1 Breakpoint set on function.
	(init /home/derick/test2.php) run
	Starting program: /home/derick/test2.php
	Breakpoint, foo()
		at /home/derick/test2.php:9
	5			$b = 2;

	(cmd) eval $_GET;
	array ()

	(cmd) cont
	Continuing.
	Breakpoint, foo()                            <<< Should not break here
		at /home/derick/test2.php:9
