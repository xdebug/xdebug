For 1.2.0:
- Update gdb debugging capabilities
  * accessing data
    o modifying variables
  * watches / conditional breakpoints
- Bug fixing
  * Disconnect bug
- Profiling
  * External data sources monitor
     create a hash-list of SQL & execution functions that can be 
     compared against the functions used in the code.
     If this external call takes > a certain pre-set time show the
     parameter passed to the function so that a person can optimize the
     query or the utility that is being called.
  * Add another profiling mode that allows for detailed function analysis.
  * Separate the profiling code into a file of its own.
- Additions
  * trace code to trace which files/lines have been touched (to check
    code coverage).

For later:
- Additions
   * Provide codes for messages (for localization) including parameters
